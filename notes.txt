    trying to build chess

    atm trying to get the board to load on the screen

2/4/23

  left off trying to figure out how to not make the game.py draw_pieces function stupid long, think i should use a for loop

  also need to make the pieces larger

2/6/23

  got all the pieces to load, still a bit small but thats okay

  need to focus on how to get the pieces to actually move now

  my idea is to have the board.py have a list of lists representation of the current board and have the display load from that list of lists 

  in order to get the piece that was selected, i need to add a rect attribute to each piece and check for collision i dont think that will take a lot of time

  also need to figure out how to manage turns
